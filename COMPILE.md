# Compiling PSXFunkin

## Setting up the Development Environment
First off, you'll need a terminal one way or another.

### Windows
On Windows, you basically have two choices:
- MSYS2 (follow the instructions at https://www.msys2.org/ to set it up)
- WSL (Windows 10 Linux terminal from the Windows Store, maintained by Microsoft, follow Linux instructions from here on).

### MSYS2
Once you have MSYS2 set up, you'll need to copy the MIPS toolchain over. Download it here http://static.grumpycoder.net/pixel/mips/g++-mipsel-none-elf-11.2.0.zip.

Once you have it downloaded, make sure MSYS2 is closed, then open the zip up and extract the following folders into `C:/msys64/usr/local/`
- bin
- include
- lib
- libexec
- mipsel-none-elf

**IMPORTANT - DELETE THESE FILES IN `bin` OR YOUR TERMINAL WILL BE FUCKED**
- cat
- cp
- echo
- make
- mkdir
- touch
- rm

Next, open up `MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit` from the Start Menu, and you'll need to install some libraries, so run the following command and accept the prompts that follow `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-tinyxml2 mingw-w64-x86_64-ffmpeg `

### Linux
First, you'll need to install the GCC toolchain, run one of the following commands depending on your distro.

On Debian derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint...):

`sudo apt-get install gcc-mipsel-linux-gnu g++-mipsel-linux-gnu binutils-mipsel-linux-gnu`

On Arch derivatives (Manjaro), the mipsel environment can be installed from AUR : cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-binutils and cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc using your AURhelper of choice:

`trizen -S cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-binutils cross-mipsel-linux-gnu-gcc`

You'll also need to install `tinyxml2`, `ffmpeg` (you may also need to install `avformat` and `swscale` separately), and `cmake`, which of course, depends on your distro of choice.

### Mac OS
First open the terminal and install brew https://brew.sh, after that run these commands one by one.

`curl -o mipsel-none-elf-binutils.rb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux/main/tools/macos-mips/mipsel-none-elf-binutils.rb'`
`curl -o mipsel-none-elf-gcc.rb 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux/main/tools/macos-mips/mipsel-none-elf-gcc.rb'`
`brew install mipsel-none-elf-binutils.rb`
`brew install mipsel-none-elf-gcc.rb`
`brew install cmake`
`brew install ffmpeg`
`brew install tinyxml2` 

## Compiling mkpsxiso
First do `git clone https://github.com/Lameguy64/mkpsxiso && cd mkpsxiso/` to clone the mkpsxiso repo and run these 2 commands.

`git submodule update --init --recursive`
`cmake . && make`
 
Finally, do `sudo cp mkpsxiso /usr/local/bin/mkpsxiso` (MSYS2 doesn't have sudo, so just ignore it)

This will allow you to call mkpsxiso from anywhere (like the PSXFunkin repo).

## Copying PsyQ files
First, go to the [mips](/mips/) folder of the repo, and create a new folder named `psyq`.

Then, download the converted PsyQ library from http://psx.arthus.net/sdk/Psy-Q/psyq-4_7-converted-light.zip. Just extract the contents of this into the new `psyq` folder.

## Compiling PSXFunkin
First, make sure to `cd` to the repo directory where all the makefiles are. You're gonna want to run a few commands from here, You'll need to either get a PSX license file and save it as licensea.dat in the same directory as funkin.xml (you can get them at http://www.psxdev.net/downloads.html 's `PsyQ SDK`), or remove the referencing line `<license file="licensea.dat"/>` from funkin.xml. Without the license file, the game may fail on a bunch of emulators due to bios checks (unless you use fast boot, I believe?)

TIP: For any make, try appending `-jX` to the end of it, where X is the number of CPU cores you have times two. This will try to put as much of your CPU as it can to doing whatever it needs to do and makes it go way quicker.

`make -f Makefile.assets` this will compile all the assets.

You can read more about the asset formats in [FORMATS.md](/FORMATS.md)

If everything went well, you should have a `funkin.bin` and a `funkin.cue` in the same directory.
